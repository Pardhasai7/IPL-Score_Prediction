# IPL First Innings Score Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a machine learning model to predict the first innings score in Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches. The analysis focuses on:

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature engineering
- Model development for score prediction

## Files Description

### 1. `First Innings Score Prediction-IPL.ipynb`

This notebook performs a comprehensive analysis of the IPL dataset and builds a prediction model. Key components include:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Score prediction implementation

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
